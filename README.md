## Manifest

HereUS PBC,

*Recognizing* the environmental benefits of digitalizing, previously printed on paper or its derivatives,
restaurant menus for sake of the environment,

*Concerned* that the capabilities of modern web browsers pose a huge security risk when used for
malicious activities,

*Desiring* a replacement for current status of digital menus to safeguard people from hacked menu
providers, fake QR codes covering official ones, rewritten NFC tags to cause malware installation, and
any other kind of security threats,

*Observing* this kind of computer attacks over digital menus are widely seen, as they offer hackers an
easier alternative to complex social engineering tactics or zero-day exploits,

*Aware* that excessive resource use by web apps to contributes to environmental degradation,

*Conscious of* substantial bills imposed on restaurants by online menu providers while, as widely used
method requires huge fees to provide cloud hosting of menus, leads to monopolization,

*Believing* technology, as an ever evolving application of science, can resolve its own shortcomings
through latest advancements,

*Emphasizing* that TheProtocols, ActivityStreams, and JSON-LD can be used to create a more secure,
more privacy-friendly, and cost-effective solution for this problem,

1. Decides to develop a new JSON-LD schema to provide restaurants cost-effective —potentially
free of charge— a federated solution for hosting menus;
2. Proclaims that the menu-reading client will integrate TheProtocols for federated data storage;
  a. Planned to be designed to minimize strain on the user’s chosen network, this integration
will empower people to self-host their own networks to own their data.
3. Decides to incorporate ActivityStreams to enable referencing of menu content from the fediverse
as notes;
4. Urges restaurants to adopt this technology to reduce costs, provide a safer experience to their
customers, and contribute to a more sustainable future;
5. Encourages existing digital menu providers to adopt this schemata to foster interoperability.

## Tech Stack

[BevyFrame](https://github.com/islekcaganmert/bevyframe) is pretty enough for all.

## FAQ

#### I want to use this at my business. How to?

This is a decentralized (federated) software, thus all you have to is to run your server.

#### I don't know how to run a server. What should I do?

You can use a static server generator and deploy to a CDN for free. HereUS will provide one soon.
Contact use to get help with deployment.

#### Why should I prefer this over others?

Well, in the non-technical description, you will no longer depend on a provider. No more fees.
More importantly, you will reduce the risk of getting your clients hacked as URL QR codes are dangerous,
you can watch [this video](https://youtu.be/cB6e-odC07Q) to see a quick demo of malicious QR code covering the real one.
Last but not least, your waiters/waitress won't be waiting next to tables when your clients can't decide, so they can serve to others.

#### What about the clients? Why this?

Simply; less prone to hacking, decentralized, and centralized... whoa, what?
Your data is kept on the network chosen by you; until you chose a network, no data will be kept.
And your data between businesses kept on a single location which means your device still knows your preferences about other businesses.
*After its AI integration, an AI will be there recommending to you or can get your order ready while you are looking for a table.*
